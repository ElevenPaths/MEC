\par
Masked Extension Control is a program that makes your Windows rely on\par
magic numbers, and not only on extensions, to choose the program that\par
will be used to open the file.\par
\par
\b Why is this program relevant? \b0
\par
\par
Attackers usually change extensions in\par
files to make you trust the file, and this is dangerous. Some very\par
popular attacks make RTF files to be opened with Word, just by modifying\par
the RTF extension to DOC or DOCX. This way, they build exploitable RTF\par
files that will take advantage of Word vulnerabilities or weaknesses to\par
release their payload. However, if these RTF files are opened with\par
WordPad, the threat will disappear. The same for .MHT files: if they are\par
opened with Word, some vulnerabilities may be exploited, but if they are\par
opened with a browser, is less likely that something happens.\par
\par
This program does not need to be resident on memory. It modifies Windows\par
registry to open MHT, DOC, RTF and DOCX files with the program that they\par
should be opened, so trusting in magic number instead of extensions.\par
If you want to stop using it, you just have to uninstall it.\par
